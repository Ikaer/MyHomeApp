One day, when Shinichi spots two suspicious men and decides to follow them, he inadvertently becomes witness to a disturbing illegal activity. Unfortunately, he is caught in the act, so the men dose him with an experimental drug formulated by their criminal organization, leaving him to his death. However, to his own astonishment, Shinichi lives to see another day, but now in the body of a seven-year-old child.\n\nPerfectly preserving his original intelligence, he hides his real identity from everyone, including his childhood friend Ran Mouri and her father, private detective Kogorou Mouri. To this end, he takes on the alias of Conan Edogawa, inspired by the mystery writers Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa.\n\nShinichi, as Conan, starts secretly solving the senior Mouri's cases from behind the scenes with his still exceptional sleuthing skills, while covertly investigating the organization responsible for his current state, hoping to reverse the drug's effects someday.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The settlement was ruled by its shrine maiden, Itsukihime, whom only a select few were allowed to interact with. When Itsukihime passed away, Shirayuki was appointed in her place. Wishing to stay in contact with her, Jinta worked diligently for years and was finally selected as the next sentinel.\n\nAs the protector of the village, Jinta's duty is to eliminate any threats. One day, he encounters a demon in a nearby forest. At the end of the battle, the demon makes a proclamation about the destined ruler of all demonkind. He attaches his severed arm to Jinta, turning him into an unaging demon man. By the time Jinta comes to, Kadono is on fire. Suzune has transformed into the demon from the divination, and due to a series of misunderstandings, she murders Shirayuki and flees.\n\nDevastated, Jinta cannot forgive Suzune for her actions; he departs on a journey to find her. As Jinta travels around Japan across the eras, he endeavors to protect as many people as possible from aggressive demons. In his quiet moments, he contemplates what he should do when he once again faces his childhood friend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the leadership of Millavair Lou Nebulis VIII, the Sovereignty aims to minimize casualties in their conflict with the Empire—a stance the extremist Zoas disagree with. Tensions rise between the families as the upcoming election to decide the next leader approaches. The Zoas are willing to do anything to achieve success; however, a world-ending war may ensue should they be victorious.\n\nPrincess Aliceliese \"Alice\" Lou Nebulis XI has no choice but to cooperate with any potential allies in order to advance towards her ultimate goal of ending the conflict that has long tormented everyone involved. This includes Iska—one of the Empire's greatest warriors and her greatest rival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After moving in with his aunt, Kyouko Misaki, he prepares to spend the summer helping her sort through a shed full of artifacts his grandmother collected over the years alongside his cousin, Umi Katou, who is staying with them.\n\nWhile adjusting to the island's slower pace, Hairi decides to spend his free time exploring. He soon meets the cheerful Tsumugi Wenders; the antisocial Shiroha Naruse; the wandering Kamome Kushima; and the sharp-tongued Ao Sorakado. Drawn into their lives and the island's subtle mysteries, Hairi is gradually swept up in a summer filled with fun, nostalgia, and life-changing moments that will stay with him forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Yet this does not stop her from daydreaming every morning as she tends to the school's beautiful flower beds that contrast her appearance.\n\nOne day, a casual encounter puts Tabata in contact with her classmate, Yousuke Ueno, who is well known for being both handsome and extremely kind. Why would such a popular student associate with a background character like her? To Tabata, it is an unfathomable situation, but can Ueno show her that looks aren't everything?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Hailing from the pristine region of Paldea, the timid Liko travels to the Kanto region to attend the Indigo Academy and become a Pokémon trainer—a person who forms relationships with Pokémon and trains them to participate in battles. Soon, Liko acquires Nyahoja, a fickle Grass-type cat Pokémon, as her first partner.\n\nPrior to Liko's transfer to Kanto, her grandmother gives her a uniquely patterned and gleaming pendant as a protective charm. However, an enigmatic organization—The Explorers—seems to know a secret about the pendant and nearly succeeds in stealing it from Liko. Fortunately, she is rescued by the Rising Volt Tacklers, a group of adventurers led by a Lizardon-riding trainer named Friede.\n\nAfter a series of encounters with The Explorers, Liko decides to join Friede's team, accompanying him and his crew members on a grand journey across the regions. Along the way, they aim to unravel not only the mysteries of the world of Pokémon, but also the power that resides within her pendant.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her editor suggests incorporating her interests into her work, but Chika is an indoor person who only thinks about manga day and night. At a loss, she feels a sudden desire to get away from everything and go on a journey somewhere. \n\nDue to the results of an online poll that she posted on a whim, Chika hops on a train and heads north from Tokyo on an impromptu solo trip. When she ends up at the top of Mount Haguro in Aizu-Wakamatsu, she realizes she feels refreshed and more motivated than before. Even if her projects get turned down again in the future, Chika plans to journey around Japan with friends old and new.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She wants to join the light music club for her high school debut, but she's too intimidated by the dazzling presence of the members to submit her application. In her moment of despair, she receives an invitation to join the a cappella club from the president, Airi Kojou...\n\nThe a cappella club is filled with unique individuals—some might say they're a bit odd. Even if they're not flashy or popular, there's a special kind of youth that connects through their voices, creating something truly unique.\n\n(Source: Pony Canyon)",

Being cheap with no reported side effects, the drug gained widespread acceptance, even though Skinner himself silently vanished one year after launching the drug. Everyone revelled in the heaven of relief and ecstasy provided by Hapna, but they would suddenly come crashing down to Earth. It is now 2052, and Skinner reappears, giving the shocking announcement that Hapna was designed to mutate into a lethal toxin, killing anyone who had consumed it. While he claims to have a cure, he will only hand it over if he is physically found within 30 days. \n\nAxel Gilberto, a maverick youngster serving a sentence of 888 years in a high-security prison, is unwillingly recruited by a group calling themselves Lazarus. Composed of eccentric misfits, the group has only one task—to find Skinner. With no means to escape and their lives on the line, Lazarus begins the hunt to find Skinner before the countdown to the end of humanity ends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The balance of the world is deeply shaken when malevolent gods known as the Four Perils break their seals and disappear together with eight million minor deities. In the absence of gods, lands become barren and famine looms in the country of the Eight Immortals. In order to restore the fragile harmony, kashi—gifted dancers and singers—must hunt the missing gods in other realms, use their performance skills to charm the deities, and seal them using the power of their rosaries.\n\nAlthough a master dancer, Ichiyou is ridiculed by his peers for his lack of singing talent. Nonetheless, the young kashi is tasked by the Eight Immortals to bring back the Four Perils before the world plunges into complete chaos. Helped by his familiars Tenkou and Kaka, Ichiyou embarks on the perilous mission given to him, with his search leading him to modern-day Japan. If he hopes to save the world, Ichiyou must also uncover the truth behind the Four Perils' disappearance—but this event seems to be disturbingly intertwined with his own past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The building serves as the official headquarters for professional Beybattles, where competitors strive to ascend all one hundred floors; at its summit, the reigning champions, Team Pendragon, await contenders worthy of challenging their title.\n\nBird Kazami, an amateur Blader, arrives in the city eager to turn professional. However, he and his teammates are crushed in their first qualifying match, prompting his companions to give up and disband their team. Fortunately, Bird is soon approached by the easygoing Ekusu Kurosu. In disguise as \"Kamen X\" to hide his identity as a former member of the undefeated Team Pendragon, Ekusu wants to climb the tower all over again. To complete their new group, they recruit skilled Beyblade expert and savvy social media influencer Multi Nanairo.\n\nDriven by their individual goals, the trio wins their preliminary rounds, launching their careers as Team Persona. Bird and his new friends must navigate the world of corporate sponsorships, earn the fickle public's support, and defeat many formidable opponents—all in their quest to reach X Tower's peak.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The sudden transfer of a girl named Satsuki Tachibana brings back traumatic memories from his past—a past she had a hand in making so unpleasant. Nasty secrets, unknown to Naoto, begin to surface with her arrival, threatening his new life. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As the two spend more time together, Tsukasa grows to appreciate Shizuri's company—and his feelings just might be mutual.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After an encounter with a healer, he throws himself into studying to become one and finally catches a break when an adventurer invites Zenos into his party. Zenos is thrilled—so thrilled, in fact, that he's willing to put up with his teammates treating him like garbage. They fail to appreciate his talents and ultimately kick him to the curb, claiming he's outlived his usefulness to them.\n\nNow bereft of money and out of options, Zenos decides to put his self-taught skills to use elsewhere and opens an underground clinic. Word quickly spreads about the brilliant healer working incredible magic in the city's shadowy underbelly. Even the royal palace is taking notice...\n\nCan Zenos buck the odds and carve out a life for himself in a world that's spit in his face? And can he save the lives of the patients who wind up on his doorstep in the process?\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",

A young boy named Kai, fighting to defend his village, sustains a life-threatening injury that causes him to regain memories from a past life. If you're not a guardian bearer, it's like you're playing life on hard mode... Kai's newfound knowledge gives him a new sense of the unfair \"rule set\" that governs the world around him. One thing is clear: For those without a god to serve as their guardian, life is a constant struggle for survival. Thus begins the epic tale of a young boy's ascent into a vast world filled with magic, bloodshed, and mystery.\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",

The Oni are careless, rash, and disorderly, while the Momotarou protect the human world from the uncontrollable Oni. Shiki Ichinose is a reckless and irresponsible teenager, aware of his defiance and even proud of his expulsion from school. Despite Shiki's rebellious attitude, his foster father, Tsuyoshi, cares about him deeply.\n\nTsuyoshi's selfless love is soon shown in an explosive incident when a Momotarou barges in looking for Shiki. As a Momotarou himself, Tsuyoshi has been hiding Shiki for years and keeping his Oni origins a secret even from him. As he gives up his life to save Shiki and confesses everything in his dying breath, Shiki's Oni blood awakens for the first time, transforming him into an unruly monster overflowing with rage and a thirst for revenge.\n\nShiki's momentary outburst attracts the attention of Naito Mudano, an Oni teacher at the Rakshasa Academy—an institution for young Oni in need of understanding and perfecting their powers. Before Shiki can avenge his father, he must learn to control his headstrong and impulsive nature and, above all, fight against his own demonic blood.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Living in a small village and being the only children their age, the two boys find solace in each other's company. Their friendship seems picturesque at first glance, but Yoshiki has noticed a shift in Hikaru's demeanor ever since one fateful summer.\n\nThe \"Hikaru\" that sits beside him now is nothing like his friend. Despite his physical appearance and memories remaining exactly the same, Yoshiki knows something is amiss and that the Hikaru he once knew is gone. When he brings this up, Hikaru partially transforms into an otherworldly being, threatening to kill Yoshiki if he cannot accept it—while also professing its love for him.\n\nWracked with grief and unable to let go of his best friend, Yoshiki struggles to move on with his life as he finds himself getting closer to the new Hikaru. At the same time, strange occurrences begin to plague their village, bringing unsettling chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A storm is about to descend on this sleepy town.\n\nWe follow Kakeru Niimi, a man who can be a bit curt at times but who has a strong sense of responsibility and a kind heart. Kakeru's ordinary life is thrown into chaos after the local shrine's sacred relic shatters. In the wake of this event, several young men and women awaken to superhuman abilities.\n\nWhat was once a run-of-the-mill life in a run-of-the-mill town soon turns into a quest to track down a super-powered serial killer before they can strike again.\n\n(Source: Sekai Project)",

Ignoring the warnings from those around him, Rudo regularly rummages through the town's garbage in search of anything useful or valuable to save from the \"Abyss\"—a massive hole where anything considered trash is dumped, including people. Rudo's biological father was one such person, having been thrown into the Abyss after he was accused of murder.\n\nOne day, after running into a mysterious figure on the way home, Rudo returns to find Regto's dying body on the floor. He is immediately found at the scene by the authorities and is charged with murder. No one believes his claims of innocence, and he is thrown into the Abyss. Instead of dying, however, he finds himself in a strange, foul-smelling place surrounded by monsters made out of trash.\n\nWhen Rudo is attacked by said monsters, he is saved by a man named Enjin, who reveals himself to be a \"Cleaner\"—someone who uses special weapons called Vital Instruments to combat these creatures. In order to get his revenge on the one who killed Regto, Rudo reluctantly becomes a Cleaner to fight his way back up and out of the Abyss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Those Gears eventually stand against humanity in a rebellion. Although they manage to overcome in the struggle for survival known as the Crusades, humanity's losses are so great that even after several decades pass, their emotional wounds remain unable to fully heal.\n\nSin Kiske, the child of a human and a Gear, heads to his father Ky and mother Dizzy's wedding ceremony. Their wedding breaks the ultimate taboo: a union between a human and a Gear. Even with the world at peace, it took many years for such a ceremony to come to fruition. Despite the complex array of emotions surrounding it, the wedding ceremony is met with blessings. When suddenly, a mysterious girl appears... The fated child inheriting Gear blood–and the mysterious girl who despises Gears. Their meeting would shake the world.\n\n(Source: Official site)",

Now starting to learn how to fight alongside his classmates and slowly growing out of his solitary past, Sakura has become the grade captain of the first-years.\n\nSakura's skills are put to the test when he and his classmates are faced with KEEL—a delinquent group known for its ruthless violence and coercion. While KEEL seems to be another rowdy group at first glance, their sudden appearance and strength in numbers might just be hiding a greater evil behind it. With all the odds against the Bofurin members, Sakura must accept that recognizing his shortcomings and receiving help from his upperclassmen will be necessary to preserve the peace in Makochi.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, in contrast to his mother, Yuu is completely talentless. Being seen as completely mediocre, he would have no chance of standing side by side with the three emperors of Saika Academy: the Mikadono sisters, Miwa, Nico, and Kazuki, who are each prodigies in shogi, martial arts, and performing arts, respectively.\n\nWith Subaru's friend agreeing to take her son in, Yuu aims to fulfill his mother's last wish to him, which is to build a happy family, after never being able to form a proper mother-son relationship due to their difference in talent. As it turns out, his mother's friend is actually the father of the Mikadono sisters! Keeping his mother's wish in mind, Yuu aims to build familial bonds with the siblings. However, due to their extreme focus on their respective specializations, they show little interest in opening themselves up not only to him, but to each other as well. Nonetheless, Yuu strives to continuously support the three prodigies, as his kindness and care restores the bond between the sisters.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Across multiple villages, all the victims have one thing in common: they had entered the so-called Werewolves' Forest right before they developed strange deformities and subsequently died. The rumors put blame on a \"witch's curse,\" the nearby villagers' firm belief based on old folklore.\n\nUnconvinced that anything truly supernatural is at play, Ciel and his contracted demonic butler, Sebastian Michaelis—along with the rest of the Phantomhive servants—come across an isolated village in the Werewolves' Forest. Its residents are only women, hostile toward the outsiders and serving a young girl with emerald eyes and bound feet, Sieglinde \"Green Witch\" Sullivan. Ciel and Sebastian investigate to uncover the truth, but as they soon fall victim to the curse themselves, it appears that there is more to the local myths than meets the eye.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Very few of its students excel enough to earn the title of Noble Maiden, awarded to those who embody the ideal Japanese woman of culture and refinement. Lilisa Suzunomiya, a girl of common roots, has suddenly found herself as the daughter of a newly remarried real estate mogul and seeks to become a Noble Maiden to prove that commoners like her can be noble as well.\n\nThe most difficult challenge Lilisa has faced in pursuit of this goal is abandoning her love of rock music to keep up the rich girl facade she must now wear. But her resolve crumbles once she happens upon Otoha Kurogane, the daughter of a prominent politician, skillfully playing the drums while rocking out in an abandoned school building. Despite initially being at odds, they embrace their passion for music together while leading a double life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With his life now turned upside down, Beryl travels to the capital and reunites with some of his former students: elite knights, an ace wizard, and even an adventurer who's attained the highest guild rank possible.

    "synopsis": "Takane Takamine is great at everything she does, and her magnetic personality makes her the envy of everyone. She gets good grades, excels at sports, and even manages to become student council president during her first year of high school. But Takamine has a secret—she possesses an ability called \"Eternal Virgin Road,\" allowing her to redo past actions and achieve a different result.\n\nWhile this might seem like a decent skill to have, Takamine must pay a price to activate it: she has to strip off a piece of her lingerie. After getting an imperfect score on a test, Takamine begins to remove her underwear during class and is spotted by her average and weak-willed classmate Koushi Shirota, who is bewildered by the sight. However, the very next instant, things reset and Takamine's test is now perfect.\n\nWhen Shirota decides to confront Takamine about her previous test score, she reveals her ability to him and blackmails him into becoming her \"closet,\" making him carry around extra lingerie and put them on her. Her goal is to be able to use Eternal Virgin Road as much as possible in order to stay at the top of the school hierarchy. Left with little choice in the matter, Shirota accepts, starting an oddly intimate type of relationship with the most popular girl at school.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, unlike the other witches, she wishes to pick a non-animal familiar. There's no better companion than Morihito \"Moi\" Otogi—her childhood friend who happens to be an ogre. Morihito is vehemently opposed to being her servant, but he reluctantly accepts his fate after learning that a curse would revert him into a strange cow-tiger hybrid were he to disobey a witch's order.\n\nDue to Morihito's father leaving for a business trip and Nico's mother remaining behind in the Witches' Holy Land, the two teens find themselves living together under the same roof. While Nico is ecstatic to be living with her crush, Morihito finds that her magical antics and overall clumsiness create more problems than solutions. With a prophesied disaster to befall Nico within the year, Morihito must do everything he can to protect her as her bodyguard while also upholding his duties as her familiar.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, no one has visited the hotel in decades, as humanity has long abandoned Earth due to its toxic atmosphere.\n\nYachiyo, the robot \"acting acting manager,\" works tirelessly every day alongside her mechanical crew to keep the hotel running in tip-top shape. Over the years, many employees have ceased functioning, with no hope of repair or replacement. Still, Yachiyo continues to fulfill her duties, just as she promised the hotel's owner before his departure. She remains optimistic that humanity will one day return to Earth—and that she will see the owner again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Flustered, Renji hastily tells her it's a Valentine's Day gift.

One day, a talking frog suddenly speaks to her, sees in her the potential to become a witch, and transports her to the Witch-Verse. There, the frog introduces Yuina to four other girls he has recruited—the cheerful Choco Mitsumata; the composed Kyouka Kitahara; the easygoing Mai Kamiizumi; and the short-fused Azu Niisato who is apprehensive of Yuina's arrival.\n\nDespite the initial clash of personalities, the five girls aim to become true witches. To achieve that goal, they must grant people's wishes in the real world through music—the most efficient conduit for channeling magic. As Yuina learns to control her newfound powers, her journey into a magical life helping others will be far more vibrant than any photo her camera can ever hope to capture.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite feeling guilty and betrayed, Belle reaffirms her resolve to set out on a journey to discover her roots—even without him.\n\nWhen Belle reunites with the comrades she fought alongside in the Catacombs, one of them—Guinness—publicly questions the circumstances surrounding the battle. He challenges the foundational laws of Schubertland, where the forces of good are expected to sacrifice their lives in the never-ending struggle against evil. Belle offers to support Guinness' petition to King Rawhide to declare the Catacombs neutral ground.\n\nMeanwhile, Adonis aligns himself with the forces of darkness. He reappears in Schubertland and targets King Rawhide, threatening to plunge the land into chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Encouraged by his girlfriend, Yuki Osanai—a seemingly average second-year student—Urino convinces the newspaper club to let him pursue an unusual story. A case of small-scale fires has escalated into serial arson, and Urino intends to predict the locations of future fires and identify the culprit. But his obsession with the case does not always reflect well on the club, and Osanai may not be so fond of her boyfriend's growing arrogance.\n\nMeanwhile, another supposedly unexceptional student, Jougorou Kobato, spends uneventful days with his girlfriend, Tokiko Nakamaru. However, when he witnesses a fire tied to a past case and Osanai herself, Kobato cannot help but slip back into his old, less-than-ordinary habits in search of the truth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While the latter boasts an immaculate reputation and favors students from wealthy backgrounds, the former is a nest for dim-witted delinquents. Everyone at Kikyo harbors a deep hatred for their Chidori neighbors.\n\nSixteen-year-old Rintarou Tsumugi is a student at Chidori whose intimidating face leads people to avoid him. Rintarou pays no mind to this, as he is content with his group of friends. However, there is something he has not told them yet: sometimes, he helps out at his family's cake shop.\n\nOne day at work, Rintarou sees a customer at a table, but she runs off before he can talk to her. The next day, he receives an apology from the girl, Kaoruko Waguri, who explains that she did not run away because of his appearance and that she believes Rintarou is a kind-hearted person. Although he is not used to Kaoruko's bright personality, Rintarou looks forward to forming a friendship with her. There is just one obstacle that stands in his way: Kaoruko is a Kikyo student!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When Kanna learns that one of her classmates has been cursed to death by a ghost, she decides to investigate the school building at night, only to find that the supposed ghost was actually Akihiko. Unwilling to disclose to the other students the existence of a hidden room filled with forbidden books where he is working, Akihito decides to spread the rumor that Kanna has exorcised the ghost by herself.\n\nAt the great dismay of Kanna, she is now viewed as an expert in the occult by her fellow classmates, who force her to investigate several paranormal-looking events. However, she can rely on the help of her teacher Akihiko who, despite his difficult character, is determined to demonstrate to the world the prevalence of reason over superstition.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Though they have their differences, the two get along well enough to experience the joys of the walled city together.\n\nHowever, everything starts to fall apart when Kudou, half-asleep, suddenly kisses Kujirai—seemingly reciprocating the feelings she has yet to confess. But when Kudou explains that he had mistaken her for someone else, Kujirai finds herself drawn into a series of events that lead her to a past she cannot remember.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In a world shaped by conformity, Hayashi is refreshingly and unapologetically true to himself. Conversely, Nikaidou has worked very hard to perfect a gloomy, dour façade that keeps his classmates far, far away. While much of the school regards Nikaidou as a bad omen, one student catches a glimpse behind the mask and-undeterred by rumors of bad luck and supernatural powers-begins to pick away Nikaidou's carefully crafted persona…\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

He is perfectly satisfied as the party's helper—until the other members kick him out and replace him with a stronger ally. Left without a way to provide for himself, Kurt begins searching for a job.\n\nWith his job prospects limited by his lack of combat ability, Kurt gladly accepts any work that comes his way. During one such job, he meets Yulishia, an adventurer formerly employed by the royal family. Surprised by Kurt's impressive work, Yulishia discovers that he is no ordinary boy: Kurt possesses an astonishingly high aptitude in a variety of non-combat fields. Due to these talents, a court official tells Yulishia to offer Kurt a high status in the kingdom that would allow him to live in peace for the rest of his life.\n\nWhen Yulishia informs Kurt about his potential rank, he brushes off the offer, refusing to think of himself as above other people. Still unaware of his real power, Kurt continues taking as many odd jobs as possible, which might just make him a pivotal part of the kingdom before he even notices it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Two sisters form the newest generation of holy women who protect the lands from monsters and calamities. The eldest, Philia, is considered a prodigy in the field, capable of solving any problem in no time. Meanwhile, the youngest, Mia, is not as extraordinary as her older sister but has charmed the entire country with her lovely personality. Despite their striking differences, Philia and Mia share an unbreakable bond.\n\nSadly, Mia is the only person who truly cares for Philia. Because of Philia's expressionless face and aloof demeanor, their parents always scold her, and the citizens complain about her. Moreover, Julius Girtonia, the second prince and Philia's fiancé, would rather have a more amicable girl as his wife-to-be. For that reason, he cancels the engagement and sells Philia off to the neighboring kingdom, Parnacorta, which has recently lost its own saint.\n\nHaving no say on the matter, Philia immediately goes to serve Parnacorta. As a foreigner, she presumes that she will not be treated much better than in Girtonia. Contrary to her expectations, Philia might have finally found a place with people worth smiling for.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Teenager Amate \"Machu\" Yuzuriha lives on a quiet space colony with her mother. Though her classmates attend taxing cram schools, Machu yearns for a more exciting life. Her wishes are answered through the crash landing of the Gundam QuuuuuuX, a state-of-the-art mobile suit used by a squad of Zeon soldiers. Machu discovers a natural affinity with the suit, and she uses it to fend off Federation forces. She is aided in her efforts by the mysterious Shuuji Itou, who pilots a Gundam that bears a remarkable resemblance to the one once used by the missing Char.\n\nUnbeknownst to Machu, her brawl is witnessed by a group of mecha enthusiasts who use mobile suits to fight in duos for competitive sport. In the pursuit of a thrilling life and human connection, Machu partners with Shuuji and engages in a series of escalating clan battles as hints of a greater conflict loom above her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He lands on Earth, but quickly finds himself in danger of captivity by its inhabitants. Fortunately, he is found by an unsmiling little girl named Shizuka Kuze, who feeds him and names him Takopii. Feeling indebted, Takopii decides to do everything in his power to bring a smile to her face.\n\nThe task is easier said than done, however. Shizuka is bullied by her classmates, she does not have a father, and her mother is never home—though the gravity of these issues flies over the naive Takopii's head. Even so, Shizuka does have one source of happiness: her dog Chappy. The connection Shizuka and Chappy share only increases Takopii's desire to make the girl smile.\n\nWhile Takopii's attempts to lift Shizuka's spirits lead to unintended consequences, he is determined to take things into his own tentacles, test his understanding of human beings, and achieve his goal of spreading happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Among them, the \"Space series\" Spirit Warriors became the strongest because of their outstanding performance in the \"Beast Tide Disaster\" and the scarcity of their awakening.

Unfortunately for him, he finds out that there is only so much he can do with a sliding ability that gives him about as much speed as a bicycle. Thus, he is drawn to extra-legal, simpler work and takes on various local tasks beyond the grasp of the police and licensed heroes.\n\nHowever, a chance encounter with two misfits, a brash brawler vigilante who goes by Knuckleduster and the online sensation Pop☆Step, gives Kouichi the opportunity he has always dreamed about. With a dangerous new Quirk-enhancing drug turning ordinary people into instant villains, Kouichi finds himself accompanying the two in a quest to stop the drug from spreading. As the trio tries to get to the bottom of the case, the chaotic team looks to put a stop to wrongdoers that go overlooked by the law.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Going with the flow here, however, means something very different. Ryou is immediately pitted against the wild lands he winds up in and the slew of deadly monsters that call the remote subcontinent home. You'd think he'd forget about taking it easy when he's stuck fighting for his life, but lucky for Ryou, he's naturally optimistic, clever, and blessed with the hidden \"Eternal Youth\" trait. Twenty years pass in the blink of an eye, and each encounter along the way pushes him one step closer to the pinnacle of human magic. Little does he realize that's only the opening chapter of his tale. A fateful meeting soon thrusts Ryou to the forefront of history, forever changing the course of his life... Thus begins the adventures of the strongest water magician the world has ever seen—who also likes to do things at his own pace!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",

Although perplexed with the situation, Ryusuke and Tomomi decide to begin their journey to the spirit world. First, they arrive in a gloomy town that looks like it’s from the 1960’s. Soon after, they are assailed by terrible things one after another. They see fear-ridden rogues killing one another and doctors mutilating patients. People die and rise. They get killed and rise again. Ryusuke and Tomomi realize that they are in hell. But their journey doesn’t end there. The adventure beyond this world continues into the unknown. Will they be able to find their mission in life?\n\n(Source: dragonheart-movie.com)",

    "synopsis": "Takeru Narihira is a lone wolf delinquent who spends his days getting into fights, avoiding friendships, and being captivated by a mysterious girl named Tsukimiya—someone he's only ever seen in his dreams.\n\nOne day, a sudden accident sends him tumbling off a cliff. When he regains consciousness, he finds himself in Denji Heian-kyou, a futuristic version of the ancient capital, where advanced technology and mysticism coexist. This world is under the protection of the legendary onmyouji, Abe no Seimei—and to Takeru's shock, Tsukimiya is real and living in this very place.\n\nJust as he begins to revel in this fated encounter, a deadly black mist known as Yamikaoru descends, bringing forth monstrous beings called Oni. In the chaos, both he and Tsukimiya are killed—only for Takeru to awaken once again in Denji Heian-kyou.\n\nRealizing he has somehow slipped through time, Takeru resolves to defy fate. To protect Tsukimiya from her doomed future, he turns to Abe no Seimei to train in the art of onmyou-jutsu. Now, as an onmyouji himself, he must fight to rewrite destiny and uncover the truth behind this strange new world.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

When they finally manage to catch it, it turns out to be a talking Pallas's cat named Nuru!\n\nNuru has come from the distant future with a serious mission to inform them that the Earth is facing an impending threat of destruction. While he says he wants to protect the Earth, he says he's only come to warn them of the crisis, and that it's up to the five of them to decide whether or not they want to fight for the Earth...\n\nIsn't this just an attempt to dodge responsibility? The Defense Club members are suspicious. \"If either is fine with you, I'll do it! That's more fashionable!\" Unzen enthusiastically says. The five decide to fight with free will, and Nuru transforms them into the Haikara Romantic Troupe using feline science.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious trio called the Bankara New Elite Squad are scheming in the shadows. They are plotting to take over the Earth.\n\n(Source: Official site, translated and edited)",

In order to rebuild the order of the martial arts world, Yan Jiyu, the leader of Changfeng Pavilion, sent messengers to various sects, intending to establish a new \"righteous\" martial arts world headed by him. However, at this time, the fledgling Yang Ren was entrusted to deliver a letter left by Dao Zong. Along the way, he was surrounded by powerful enemies and was extremely dangerous, but he relied on his passion and chivalry to constantly break through himself and defeat his opponents. While his martial arts skills improved rapidly, he also met a group of chivalrous and righteous people. What should the martial arts world look like? Yang Ren couldn't answer, but he knew it was definitely not what Yan Jiyu said. Yang Ren put up a big banner: \"Chengfeng Gang\", and quickly gathered together.\n\n(Source: Iqiyi, translated)",

She has randomly invited herself along on her detective friend Michelangelo's missing-person investigation. It seems the case is one of seven sudden vanishings in an astronomical pattern across Cat Japan that occurred at the exact same moment one night. Their search leads ever deeper into a mystery with ancient, occult roots and apocalyptic implications—and threads leading to Tamala herself. Shadowed by a covert agent of the Catty & Co. consortium, she may in fact be the greatest enigma. Indolent ingénue? Megacorporate mascot? Mythic messiah, or manifestation of cosmic malevolence? Anyhow, wow—she sure is a great dancer!\n\n(Source: Fantasia International Film Festival)",
